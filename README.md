# Pulover macro creator - useful macros
a collection of macros for generic productivity improvement (improved windows management, Evernote, etc.)

## Some details
Pulover Macro Creator is a coding environment for creating macros. Its GUI contains many helpers for example to record mouse movements and keystrokes, programming via mostly drag-and-drop, step-through/debugging macros etc.

Macros-based workflows are often frowned upon: they seem like temporary solutions that should be ideally addressed in some better way, for example via "proper" API use, or it seems like they should be entirely replaced by "adept"/"proficient" or "dedicated" workflows (e.g. using programs that support scripting).

However, there is sometimes a place for Macros like these, firstly because they are fast to put together and experiment with, and secondly because there might just be no API or scripting solution available.

These macros can be triggered by your unused Fn keys, or by an external keypad (either a normal one or one with programmable keys).

This repo contains some macros that useful to:
* improve generic workflows (e.g. window management helpers)
* provide shortcuts for some productivity/programming tools I use (e.g. Evernote, windows terminal, Sublime text)
